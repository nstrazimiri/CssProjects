							<h2>I Love Hiking</h2>
							<p>
							Hiking is not just a desire to visit a countryside. Its a 'tool' to escape the crowded cities and be alone in the nature.
							Nature is amazing. Just stading there, watching how nature exists and deals with all its components is relaxing.
							The air is fresh. The color of the plants there is eye-relaxing.
							Since being in Albania I liked to go in nature and hike the nearby mountains.
							Now that I am in Canada, I have seen that the nature here is amazing. You have plenty of places you can visit.
							So far I have visited the Killarney Provincial Park, and some small parks around Windsor.
							I hope that I will start to visit one by one all interesting places here.

							<h2>Why Hiking is good for your body</h2>
							<p>It's good for you, too. Hiking is a powerful cardio workout that can:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Lower your risk of heart disease</li>
								<li>Improve your blood pressure and blood sugar levels</li>
								<li>Boost bone density, since walking is a weight-bearing exercise</li>
								<li>Build strength in your glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, and the muscles in your hips and lower legs</li>
								<li>Strengthen your core</li>
								<li>Improve balance</li>
								<li>Help control your weight </li>
								<li>Boost your mood. "Research shows that hiking has a positive impact on combating the symptoms of stress and anxiety," says Gregory A. Miller, PhD, president of the American Hiking Society. "Being in nature is ingrained in our DNA, and we sometimes forget that."</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>How to Hike</h2>
							<p>You can get more out of your hiking with these fitness-boosting strategies.</p>
							<p><strong>Start slow.</strong> A short, local hike is best for beginners. Gradually work up to trails with hills or uneven terrain.</p>
							<p><strong>Use poles.</strong> Digging into the ground and propelling yourself forward pushes your upper body muscles to work harder and gives you a stronger cardio workout.</p>
							<p><strong>Head for the hills.</strong> Even a small hill will intensify your heart rate and burn extra calories. Miller says a 5% to 10% incline equals a 30% to 40% increase in calorie burn.</p>
							<p><strong>Bump it up.</strong> Uneven terrain can work muscles while improving balance and stability.</p>
